<p style="text-align: justify">I'm an experienced Engineering Leader with more than 10 years experience leading and scaling Engineering teams. I've had the opportunity to lead teams at companies of varying stages from <a href="https://drizly.com">Series A</a> through <a href="https://salsify.com">Series F</a>. I'm currently leading Engineering at <a href="https://prismatic.io">Prismatic</a> a fully remote SaaS company working to integrations between products and customers easier. As an Engineer I worked truly full-stack, from native or hybrid mobile to web, and systems and (and even some devops). While I'll always be an engineer at heart, today, I get more excited at the opportunity to solve business, product and organizational problems through an engineering lens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I live in the Boston area with <a href="http://joryburson.com">my wife</a>, kids, and custom built BBQ smoker. I spend my non-work time cooking (ask me about pastrami), chasing kids, and perpetually trying to qualify for regional amateur golf tournaments.</p>
