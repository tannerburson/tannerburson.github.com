h2. iruel.net

This is the source for my personal blog and showcase on the internets, "iruel.net":http://iruel.net. It is heavily based on jduff's "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ configuration (Jekyll is a static site generator) and includes a set of rake tasks to automate deployment via SFTP to my "web host":https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/, which I highly recommend. 

Over time, it will (I guess) diverge more in terms of look.

h3. host.yml

The webhost SSH connection info is stored in a YAML file called *host.yml*, and should be self explanatory - the 'pass' key is optional, if it's not present you'll be prompted for the SSH password.

All code is MIT licensed (as Jekyll), but content under the *_drafts* and *_posts* folders is (c) 2009 Bruno Antunes.
