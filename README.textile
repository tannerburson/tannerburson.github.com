h2. iruel.net

This is the source for my personal blog and showcase on the internets, "iruel.net":http://iruel.net. It is heavily based on jduff's "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ configuration (Jekyll is a static site generator) and includes a set of rake tasks to automate deployment via SFTP to my "web host":https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/, which I highly recommend, but it's generic enough to work with any SSH/SFTP-enabled webhost. 

Over time, it will (I guess) diverge more in terms of look, and I'll be adding some more pages.

h3. host.yml

The webhost SSH connection info is stored in a YAML file called *host.yml*, and should be self explanatory - the 'pass' key is optional, if it's not present you'll be prompted for the SSH password on every upload task call.

All code is MIT licensed (as Jekyll), but content under the *_drafts* and *_posts* folders is (c) 2009 Bruno Antunes.
