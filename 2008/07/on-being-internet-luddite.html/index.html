			<div>Welcome to the blog of the world&#8217;s only web programming Internet Luddite (as far as I know). Why would any sane individual who makes a living working on and with the Internet describe themselves as a Luddite? It&#8217;s simple. Despite (or possibly because of) being one of the most technically capable people in my social circle, I&#8217;m often the last to adopt the newest online service and in some cases I&#8217;m actively campaigning against them.  It&#8217;s to the point that people have quit sending me invites, friend requests, pokes, or whatever.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t actively maintain a facebook profile.  I have one, but it was setup by my wife, and I don&#8217;t login regularly.  I don&#8217;t have a myspace account.  I don&#8217;t follow anyone on twitter.  I don&#8217;t have any delicious bookmarks.  In fact, I&#8217;ve all but avoided almost all of the social networking services out there.  I just recently started subscribing to and following RSS feeds.  This is my first real blog.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ve been developing web sites and web applications both as a hobby and a profession for about six years.  I wrote my first blog engine probably in 2003 for a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">very</span> web 1.0 social site.  I wrote an RSS feed parser/generator around the same time.  I&#8217;ve built large enterprisey applications (boooo), and am about to launch a light and lean Web 1.99 application (stay tuned for details!). So why haven&#8217;t I latched onto the Holy Grail of Web 2.0, the social network?</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;m a simple person.  I&#8217;m not an extrovert.  I value my privacy.  Most importantly, I&#8217;m lazy. My experiences show me that the current crop of social networking applications, don&#8217;t fit my needs.  Most of them have too many features (facebook, myspace), have poor track records with privacy (facebook, myspace), or require a time investment to keep them from overwhelming me with data  (facebook, myspace, twitter).  The other major issue, which really is at the core of a lot of the privacy problems I have with these services, is that they assume that I want to share some or all of my data with others.  If I wanted to share my links, my photos, or my documents with others, I&#8217;d use something simple and direct, like IM or email.  I know, how quaint!</div><div><br /></div><div>So what applications and sites do I use then?  I&#8217;m a fan of what I&#8217;ll call &#8220;Fire and Forget&#8221; services.  RSS readers are a good example of this, I subscribe to a feed, and the reader keeps track of everything for me.  It doesn&#8217;t email me everytime every blog I&#8217;m subscribed to changes (unless I was to set it to do so), it just sits and waits for me to come back.  I can skim over them, read them, or mark them all as read and move on.  Managing my RSS list can be done at my own time.  Most importantly to me, I can handle each message individually, or choose to ignore all of the changes and start with a blank slate again.</div><div><br /></div><div>My favorite social services, are ones in which the social features that I use are almost exclusively anonymous.  Last.fm music suggestions have brought me to a variety of music I wouldn&#8217;t have ever found otherwise, but it does so without requiring a huge commitment from me.  I install their application, and listen to music like normal.  When I decide I want to check my recommendations, I can play them at my own leisure.  Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;others who bought this also looked at/bought&#8230;&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve found great music and books this way as well, typically without ever being logged in.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well there&#8217;s the brief bit about who I am, where this blog came from, and what you can expect.  Thanks!</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8211;Your friendly neighborhood Luddite.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE: </span>It has been brought to my attention, that the term Luddite may not be as well known as I had previously thought.  For a bit of background check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">article at the repository for all the world&#8217;s knowlege.</a></div>
