		<div class="content">
			I can&#8217;t go a single day without hearing (or overhearing) a conversation from a friend or acquaintance discussing one social network or another.  I usually roll my eyes, or ignore these conversations.  As an internet luddite, I try to avoid these time sucking privacy invasive services.  But today I did something, something so contrary to my years of preaching that I felt it necessary to explain my motives.<br /><br />Today I joined  twitter, the poster-child for time wasting, self-indulgent, Web 2.0 buzzword compliance.  What could possibly make such an adamant hater of social networking pull such a 180 overnight?  It&#8217;s really simple,  shameless self-promotion.<br /><br />I spent several days last week at a conference, Tulsa Tech Fest, meeting many very interesting people.  I found quickly that social networks, particularly twitter, were the dominant means of communication and organization amongst the conference attendees that I was most interested in keeping up with.  I heard many tales of meetups, and user groups, all of which are held in places that aren&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">here</span></span>.<br /><br />If I want an opportunity to get out of here, and do the sort of work I&#8217;d like to do, for the sort of company I&#8217;d like to be doing it for, I&#8217;ve got to be something more than another obscure, unknown developer.  Given that I&#8217;m not currently able to live in a more developer friendly area, the best option for moving forward in my goals, is shameless self-promotion.  Now, back to how this all relates to twitter.<br /><br />I&#8217;m excepting my self-imposed ban on social networking, for purely self-serving reasons.  I need a way to better communicate with others who are working towards the same ends that I am.  Several years ago, the most prevalent tool for this sort of communication was IRC.  But my brief and informal survey seems to show that a lot of conversation has moved to the vast unorganized land of twitter.<br /><br />So here I am, forsaking my self imposed title as an internet luddite in exchange for the chance for some shameless self-promotion.  Sometimes, I guess, we all make sacrifices in exchange for making progress towards our goals.  With that in mind, I humbly apologize for my hypocrisy, and by all means <a href="http://twitter.com/tannerburson">follow me on twitter.</a> (sigh)
