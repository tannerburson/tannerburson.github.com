<p>My name (surprisingly) is Tanner Burson. I'm a software developer, beard grower, Lebowski fan, and displaced Okie currently residing in the Greater Boston Area.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, you can probably find me somewhere with <a href="http://thestoryofjory.com">my lovely wife</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contact me you can do so via <a href="mailto:tanner.burson@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/tannerburson">twitter</a>.</p>
