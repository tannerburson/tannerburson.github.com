			<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I got a <span class="caps">PDA</span> (A Sharp Zaurus, running Linux to be exact) in 2001. By 2003, I was on my third <span class="caps">PDA</span>, my cell-phone could act as a bluetooth modem, and it had a camera. Skip forward a few years, and there&#8217;s Palm&#8217;s, Blackberry&#8217;s, and Android devices. In 10 years I&#8217;ve gone through a dozen PDAs and cell-phones, each with more features and capabilities than the last. But in 2011, I&#8217;m moving backwards, I traded my Android phone in for a $20 nearly-disposable flip phone.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t a spur of the moment decision, I&#8217;ve been plotting, and thinking, and planning this for months. I started telling folks in December that I would ditch my smartphone in 2011. They almost uniformly had the same response, disbelief. How was I going to go back to not having internet access with me all the time. I wouldn&#8217;t have automatic syncing with my google calendar, or contacts. No email, no web sites, no camera, nothing, just phone calls and sms.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s the question everyone wants to know. Why on earth would I give up all the benefits of a smartphone? I don&#8217;t know. Part of me says this is crazy, stupid, and I&#8217;ll be clamoring for a new phone within a month. The other part of me says this is a valid personal study, and might provide worthwhile insight. I&#8217;m listening to the latter part, and trying to answer two questions in the process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Does a smart phone actually make my life easier or better in some appreciable way?</li>
	<li>How do my daily routines, and general habits change when I don&#8217;t have constant hand-held access to the internet?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at bare minimum this experience provides me with better knowledge about what features I actually need in a smartphone, so my next purchase can be more about function than form.</p>
<h2>How&#8217;s it going?</h2>
<p>I took the plunge right before New Years. I went to Wal-Mart and bought the absolute cheapest T-Mobile compatible phone I could find, it was a $19.99 Samsung flip-phone of some sort. It&#8217;s small, light, and absolutely mediocre at all of it&#8217;s basic functions. Which makes it pretty prime for this kind of experiment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now a couple of weeks into my little experiment, and I can tell you that I&#8217;m a bit twitchy everytime I open my email. Did i get 5 emails or 500 since I last checked? Did I miss an email from the boss? There is some noticable apprehension when I open my email. But it does seem to be subsiding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also become hyper-aware of other people using smartphones. Sitting at a restaurant I noticed an entire table playing with iPhones, and completely ignoring each other. I hope I wasn&#8217;t one of those oblivious people when I was using mine, but I probably was.</p>
<p>As to how I&#8217;m progressing on answering my two big questions? Well, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve really missed having a smart phone with me all the time. If anything, the week-long (yes, I charge this thing once a week) battery life of my phone, means that I&#8217;m even less aware that I even have a phone with me.</p>
<p>The second question is probably harder for me to answer directly, but I have noticed some small things. I have no idea what the weather is supposed to be like today, or tomorrow, or a week from now. None. I think I&#8217;m actually organizing my email better. Since I&#8217;m not skimming a lot of email on my phone, I&#8217;m actually doing a better job of sorting and filing email as I see it come in. I need a small camera I can actually stick in a bag and have with me most of the time.</p>
<h2>And&#8230;</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll post another follow up to this later, once this change has really sunk in. In the meantime, wish me luck, I feel like I&#8217;m going to need it.</p>
