			I&#8217;d intended this post to be a yet another glorious rant against twitter, but as I was gathering my thoughts on how I wanted to put it together I realized the issues I had with twitter are found in plenty of non-twitter sites.  The problem really starts with my uncontrollable laziness.  If a site requires me to continually visit it, just to stay on top of the goings on of the service, then I&#8217;ll inevitably end up ignoring it, as any of my friends (in the non-social network sense) can attest.  The &#8220;solution&#8221; to this, is what I call a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Fire and Forget</span> service.  I set it up, start using it, but even if I don&#8217;t come back for six months, I don&#8217;t have to deal with any extra tasks punishing me for being away.  Facebook is a great example, that I&#8217;m fairly familiar with, at failing <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">miserably</span> at this so let&#8217;s break it down a bit.<br /><br />To write this post I logged into facebook for the first time in I don&#8217;t know how long.  What I find upon logging in is a &#8220;News Feed&#8221; full of every minute detail of everyone on my list&#8217;s life.  There&#8217;s so much data there I immediately ignore it.  I then am told I have 6 friend requests, 7 green patch requests, and 15 other requests.  I only know for sure what one of those three categories means.  So I&#8217;ll check out my friend requests.  Turns out that clicking on friends requests just puts it at the top of the list of nearly 30 miscellaneous requests for me to check out.  At a glance there is only one friends requests I care about, so I accept it.  Now I want to ignore the rest of the mess on my screen.  The only solution? Clicking each one of the ignore boxes individually until they&#8217;re all gone, no select-all, nothing but individual actions.  I can select all in my email, in my RSS feeds, hell in my news groups, but not on facebook.  Now I realize that the reason this problem even occurs is due to the fact that it&#8217;s been months since I last logged in.  But so what?  Just because I choose to use the service infrequently, does not mean I should be punished with performing various forms of &#8220;account maintenance&#8221; when I do decide to log in.<br /><br />Now one could argue that facebook provides email notifications to keep this problem in check.  You don&#8217;t have to log in all the time, just when they notify you about something requiring your attention.  Which sounds great, until that friend of yours goes on a picture tagging spree, and you get a dozen emails about all the pictures you now appear in.  To combat this issue you can opt out of those notifications.  After a quick look of my personal notification settings, I&#8217;m given the option of disabling 37 separate notification options.  Again without a select-all type option, I would have to click through each one and disable it.  I can setup a spam to block facebook faster than that (and conveniently already have).<br /><br />When you signup for a facebook account facebook puts the burden on you, the user, to keep the service running, and under control.  By simply accepting a few friends to your facebook account, you implicitly agree to carry the burden of keeping facebook from overwhelming you.<br /><br />So there&#8217;s my small rant about how things are all wrong, and how I know so much better.  But I haven&#8217;t really provided any concrete examples of the way things can be better.  So let&#8217;s walk through some key ideas of <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Fire and Forget</span> services.<div><ul><li>Users are lazy, and already approaching information overload</li><li>Make defaults for user contact opt-in, not opt-out</li><li>Hide old, and possibly irrelevant data</li><li>Allow digest style notifications</li><li>Whenever reasonable, add select all/none options</li><li>Make complete account removal simple</li><li>Don&#8217;t burden the user</li><li>Allow things to auto-expire</li></ul>This list is not inclusive, and has the implied caveat of &#8220;whenever applicable and reasonable&#8221; to every item.  The idea is to let the service run itself, I want to set it up (<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Fire)</span> and not have to manage it daily (<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Forget)</span>.  The key is letting me spend my time <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">using</span> the service not <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">managing </span>the service.  It&#8217;s a simple list of things that will make your services more friendly to your less frequent users, without inconveniencing your constant users.  Everything on this list could be implemented almost universally.  Even twitter, the poster child for information overload, could handle almost all of these options, which is proven by the considerable number of third-party twitter add-ons offering a large majority of these features.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Consider it a list of things to keep in mind when you&#8217;re developing a new service to keep people like me happier.  If your service followed these suggestions I might even use your new application that will revolutionize and harmonize my social experiences with friends, family, and co-workers.  But probably not.</div><div><br /></div>

		<time>17 July 2008</time>

		<div class="content">
			While reading through the top links on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming">proggit</a>, I ran into a project I&#8217;d seen a long while ago and promised myself I&#8217;d keep track of.  I didn&#8217;t.  But this story isn&#8217;t about me and my need for a simple bookmarking/reminder service, and the ways in which such a thing could change how I keep track of interesting things on the web.  That story will come later.  No this story is about <a href="http://www.clutter-project.org/"> the clutter project</a>, the project I had accidentally lost track of.<br /><br />From reading their very dark website, you&#8217;ll discover that clutter is YAGUIWT(Yet Another GUI Widget Toolkit).  What makes it special?  It&#8217;s cross platform-ish, has bindings to a ton of languages, and supposedly doesn&#8217;t bring the cruft that most of the well known toolkits have grown to contain.  Despite being a bit dark, and being quite a visual shift from reddit&#8217;s simple blue on white look, it&#8217;s a visually appealing site that has the touches of professional design.  It was easy to get my bearings on the site and find information about the project and things of interest, save for one little subtle thing.  Screenshots.<br /><br />Again, the clutter project, is a GUI/Widget toolkit, a graphical tool to make your applications usable by the masses.  A tool that claims to work across several platforms, and languages.  But most importantly, it&#8217;s end result is a visible GUI application.  I thought at first that I was just missing the link to the screenshots. They have to be there.  Maybe they&#8217;re just not linked off of one of the top pages.  Who would make a well designed, and informative web page about a GUI/Widget toolkit, and not put up any screenshots?  So, being the resourceful individual that I am, I moved on to the omnipresent google.  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=site:clutter-project.org+screenshot&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">This search</a> should return all the instances of the word screenshot on their site.  That&#8217;s bound to turn up these hidden screenshots.  Except it doesn&#8217;t.<br /><br />Failing to put up screenshots has obviously not caused the death of the project.  But it&#8217;s still a failure.  A subtle failure, but a failure nonetheless.  They&#8217;ve failed at managing their user&#8217;s expectations.  They&#8217;ve failed by forcing me to go hunt for information, that should be clearly displayed on their site.  Or at the very least made it known that the information wasn&#8217;t provided by the site.  Despite failing to provide me with information I think is pertinent, as a programmer I&#8217;m still very intrigued by their product.  <br /><br />The time I spent hunting for the missing screenshots (and subsequently writing this post) should have been spent reading the API docs, or downloading the source, or installing a binary package, or a sample application, or any other activity that could lead to me becoming an active user, contributor, or at the least a vocal supporter.  Instead I&#8217;ll add the project back to my mental (or conveniently web based, and amazingly intuitive, and hopefully soon to be released) list of things to check back on when I have time.  Odds are good that like the last time, I won&#8217;t.

		<time>07 July 2008</time>

		<div class="content">
			<div>Welcome to the blog of the world&#8217;s only web programming Internet Luddite (as far as I know). Why would any sane individual who makes a living working on and with the Internet describe themselves as a Luddite? It&#8217;s simple. Despite (or possibly because of) being one of the most technically capable people in my social circle, I&#8217;m often the last to adopt the newest online service and in some cases I&#8217;m actively campaigning against them.  It&#8217;s to the point that people have quit sending me invites, friend requests, pokes, or whatever.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t actively maintain a facebook profile.  I have one, but it was setup by my wife, and I don&#8217;t login regularly.  I don&#8217;t have a myspace account.  I don&#8217;t follow anyone on twitter.  I don&#8217;t have any delicious bookmarks.  In fact, I&#8217;ve all but avoided almost all of the social networking services out there.  I just recently started subscribing to and following RSS feeds.  This is my first real blog.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ve been developing web sites and web applications both as a hobby and a profession for about six years.  I wrote my first blog engine probably in 2003 for a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">very</span> web 1.0 social site.  I wrote an RSS feed parser/generator around the same time.  I&#8217;ve built large enterprisey applications (boooo), and am about to launch a light and lean Web 1.99 application (stay tuned for details!). So why haven&#8217;t I latched onto the Holy Grail of Web 2.0, the social network?</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;m a simple person.  I&#8217;m not an extrovert.  I value my privacy.  Most importantly, I&#8217;m lazy. My experiences show me that the current crop of social networking applications, don&#8217;t fit my needs.  Most of them have too many features (facebook, myspace), have poor track records with privacy (facebook, myspace), or require a time investment to keep them from overwhelming me with data  (facebook, myspace, twitter).  The other major issue, which really is at the core of a lot of the privacy problems I have with these services, is that they assume that I want to share some or all of my data with others.  If I wanted to share my links, my photos, or my documents with others, I&#8217;d use something simple and direct, like IM or email.  I know, how quaint!</div><div><br /></div><div>So what applications and sites do I use then?  I&#8217;m a fan of what I&#8217;ll call &#8220;Fire and Forget&#8221; services.  RSS readers are a good example of this, I subscribe to a feed, and the reader keeps track of everything for me.  It doesn&#8217;t email me everytime every blog I&#8217;m subscribed to changes (unless I was to set it to do so), it just sits and waits for me to come back.  I can skim over them, read them, or mark them all as read and move on.  Managing my RSS list can be done at my own time.  Most importantly to me, I can handle each message individually, or choose to ignore all of the changes and start with a blank slate again.</div><div><br /></div><div>My favorite social services, are ones in which the social features that I use are almost exclusively anonymous.  Last.fm music suggestions have brought me to a variety of music I wouldn&#8217;t have ever found otherwise, but it does so without requiring a huge commitment from me.  I install their application, and listen to music like normal.  When I decide I want to check my recommendations, I can play them at my own leisure.  Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;others who bought this also looked at/bought&#8230;&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve found great music and books this way as well, typically without ever being logged in.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well there&#8217;s the brief bit about who I am, where this blog came from, and what you can expect.  Thanks!</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8211;Your friendly neighborhood Luddite.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE: </span>It has been brought to my attention, that the term Luddite may not be as well known as I had previously thought.  For a bit of background check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">article at the repository for all the world&#8217;s knowlege.</a></div>
