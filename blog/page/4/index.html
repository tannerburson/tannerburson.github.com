			Today I read something very annoying.  I&#8217;d read of this &#8220;problem&#8221; before, but for some reason it&#8217;s rampant stupidity never really struck a chord with me.  I read a blog post/article/something involving a group of people trying to design a system to handle the transfer of your digital data in the event that you unexpectedly get hit by that bus everyone always talks about.<br /><br />My first thought was that this was indeed a problem that would only grow in significance thanks to everyone being told to live in &#8220;the cloud&#8221;.  Upon further thought, this is one of the most pointless things anyone has ever wasted time on, and I should know, I&#8217;ve wasted a lot of time on pointless things.  Sidebar: What level of irony does this post reach?<br /><br />One of the key reasons this is incredibly pointless is that the problem has been faced, in varying forms, for hundreds of years.  Just because the data is now in a computer, doesn&#8217;t change the nature of the problem.  To prove this, let&#8217;s break down the process of what is actually being considered.<ol><li>There is data that is important to you, that you don&#8217;t want others to read, so it is protected by some form of password</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">You don&#8217;t want to write down your important account information as it changes because that is too cumbersome</span></li><li>You are now dead</li><li>You now wish your private data to be shared with your loved ones (or something)</li></ol>Replace data with &#8220;sharp rock good at killing things&#8221;, and &#8220;password&#8221; with &#8220;which bush near the cave I hid it under&#8221; and you&#8217;ve got roughly the same issue.  <br /><br />I understand the problem that many people face today of thinking that somehow using the internet in the solution to a problem makes the solution inherently better, but in this case it&#8217;s going way too far. The real problem here isn&#8217;t a technical one, or a social one, it&#8217;s simple human laziness.  People are considering working on very complicated public key signing mechanisms, or notification/verification systems, or something else equally as complicated to solve the problem of people being too lazy to write down a couple of lines of data every few months.  (A note to lazy readers like myself, the laziness in the process is in bold)<br /><br />After great thought, I have come to what I believe to be the <span style="font-style:italic;">ultimate</span> solution to this problem. <ul><br /><li>Write down important account information (usernames, account numbers, etc).</li><li>Write down a list of possible passwords, because we all know no one is changing their password to something totally unique for every service they use every 60 days.</li><li>Write down your most common challenge question/responses.</li><li>Place the above information in a safe, either at your house, or at a bank.</li><li>Leave a key somewhere safe, inform your loved ones that should you finally get hit by that bus that everyone always talks about, the safe has usernames and passwords they may find helpful.</li></ul>You may now sleep easier knowing that your loved ones can access all of your excellent daily stock tip emails, and unsolicited offers for medication long after your untimely demise.<br /><br />Now that I&#8217;m done ranting, what did I learn from this little thought exercise? The people discussing this topic aren&#8217;t stupid, hell I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re smarter and more accomplished than I am.  So why are they wasting time trying to fix a problem that can&#8217;t really be fixed? They&#8217;re either participating in a mental exercise of their own, or they put on their Mental Blinders.  <br /><br />Mental Blinders is what I call the &#8220;thing&#8221; that happens when we constrain ourselves to a particularly narrow solution set, often in the process ignoring simpler or more effective solutions.<br /><br />The next time I find myself slogging through an increasingly complicated solution to a problem, I need to remind myself to stand  back and see if I&#8217;ve put on my blinders.

			Once upon a time, there was an open source project.  This project was a relatively community driven MVC framework for PHP 4/5.  For a several years things were good, the project leaders were active, and the community was happy.<br /><br />Then one day the project leader vanished!  People were concerned, but kept on working, as they really loved the project.  Things continued in this way for several weeks.  But then a change happened, the leader stepped down, and named his replacement, and all was well again.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes!  After many months of calm and quiet the projects dedicated server crashed, the admins had no backups, and without a gathering place, the community vanished in

		<time>16 October 2008</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<div>On an average day I&#8217;ll touch three different operating systems, and a pile of applications on each one, and I&#8217;ve come to an important realization for me as a programmer: operating systems, and most applications, suck.  Tying your business to any one of them undermines your business from the start (but is often a necessary evil).  Most applications don&#8217;t respect your data, and actively work to make your life more difficult.  </div><div><br /></div><div>My day job involves working closely with our art department, who all use Macs, and their work products (primarily images).  Because of this, it&#8217;s convenient for me to also work on a Mac, to simplify the sharing of data as much as possible.  This works out really nicely, until I need to edit a document that a manager created in MS Office 2007.  I&#8217;ve got Office on my machine, but it won&#8217;t edit that file, or it&#8217;s missing some chart, or annotation, or what have you.  The fact that it was created in Office is unimportant, what&#8217;s important is the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">data in the file</span></span> not the file itself.  The file format is actively preventing me from getting to the data.<br /></div><div><br />Applications may be irrelevant, but what isn&#8217;t irrelevant is user data.  The important choices when developing, or evaluating a new system aren&#8217;t whether to use OSX or Windows or Linux.  What&#8217;s important is deciding what needs to be done, what the constraints are (cost, time, etc) and what to do with the data.  Does the data need to be secured from all prying eyes?  Displayed prominently on a website?  Printed to paper and stored in a humidity controlled vault in an abandoned salt mine at an undisclosed location?  All of the above depending on the phase of the moon?<br /><br />The applications that I enjoy working with the most are the ones that understand that the way I need to see my data today may not be what I need tomorrow.  When you design an application, be it on the web, or the desktop, think about the ways in which you show and share data with your users.  Is it easy for them to change the format?  Is it easy for them to get at the data in as raw a form as is applicable?  If your answer to either of the above is &#8216;no&#8217;, then you&#8217;re not respecting your users.<br /></div><br />I don&#8217;t want to have to use MS Office to read my data I&#8217;ve exported from your site.  I don&#8217;t want to be stuck with only a PDF.  I want the option to get raw, unformatted text, or a formatted TeX doc (yes, yes, wishful thinking).  I want the option to get a simple CSV file, or RSS/Atom feed.  I want control of my data.  I want the comfort of knowing I can get my data out of your system, for my own uses, with as few restrictions as possible. Because I don&#8217;t expect you to know every possible way that I may want to use my data.  But I don&#8217;t want you restricting me from certain options based on limited export options.<br /><br /><div>So, what&#8217;s the point? (Other than that I&#8217;m apparently trying to become the next Steve Yegge, yeeshk this is getting long winded)  The point is that it doesn&#8217;t matter what OS you use, it probably sucks.  The applications you use are less important than the data you&#8217;re creating in them.  What&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">really</span></span> important is having the data that&#8217;s needed, in the format it&#8217;s needed in, when it&#8217;s needed and if you&#8217;re preventing your users from doing this, you&#8217;re ripe for replacement.<br /></div>

		<h1><a href="/2008/10/on-shameless-self-promotion-in-time-of.html">on shameless self-promotion in a time of social networks</a></h1>
		<time>12 October 2008</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			I can&#8217;t go a single day without hearing (or overhearing) a conversation from a friend or acquaintance discussing one social network or another.  I usually roll my eyes, or ignore these conversations.  As an internet luddite, I try to avoid these time sucking privacy invasive services.  But today I did something, something so contrary to my years of preaching that I felt it necessary to explain my motives.<br /><br />Today I joined  twitter, the poster-child for time wasting, self-indulgent, Web 2.0 buzzword compliance.  What could possibly make such an adamant hater of social networking pull such a 180 overnight?  It&#8217;s really simple,  shameless self-promotion.<br /><br />I spent several days last week at a conference, Tulsa Tech Fest, meeting many very interesting people.  I found quickly that social networks, particularly twitter, were the dominant means of communication and organization amongst the conference attendees that I was most interested in keeping up with.  I heard many tales of meetups, and user groups, all of which are held in places that aren&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">here</span></span>.<br /><br />If I want an opportunity to get out of here, and do the sort of work I&#8217;d like to do, for the sort of company I&#8217;d like to be doing it for, I&#8217;ve got to be something more than another obscure, unknown developer.  Given that I&#8217;m not currently able to live in a more developer friendly area, the best option for moving forward in my goals, is shameless self-promotion.  Now, back to how this all relates to twitter.<br /><br />I&#8217;m excepting my self-imposed ban on social networking, for purely self-serving reasons.  I need a way to better communicate with others who are working towards the same ends that I am.  Several years ago, the most prevalent tool for this sort of communication was IRC.  But my brief and informal survey seems to show that a lot of conversation has moved to the vast unorganized land of twitter.<br /><br />So here I am, forsaking my self imposed title as an internet luddite in exchange for the chance for some shameless self-promotion.  Sometimes, I guess, we all make sacrifices in exchange for making progress towards our goals.  With that in mind, I humbly apologize for my hypocrisy, and by all means <a href="http://twitter.com/tannerburson">follow me on twitter.</a> (sigh)

		<h1><a href="/2008/08/on-blinking-lights-and-wasting-time.html">on blinking lights and wasting time</a></h1>
		<time>15 September 2008</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<div><div><div><h3>or how I learned to quit being interrupted and regain my productivity</h3></div><div>Hello, my name is Tanner, and I&#8217;m addicted to blinking lights.  The addiction costs me hours of my life every week, and it&#8217;s time to quit.  From the minute I wake up to my screeching blinking alarm clock, until I turn off the TV, put down the phone, and go to sleep I&#8217;m blasted by little blinking lights. In every part of our life we&#8217;re conditioned to pay attention to bright blinking lights, microwaves, fire alarms, emergency vehicles, phones, alarm clocks, status lights on every gadget under the sun, so why should our offices be any different.    But how do you even start trying to break a lifetime of psychological conditioning?  I set out on a quest, a quest to regain my productivity at the office from the blinking lights.  For one week I did everything I could to disable all of the blinking lights I&#8217;d found controlling my time, and in the process figured out how to regain control of my own time.</div><br /><div>I work in your average office, working average hours (8am-5pm, 5 days a week).  I&#8217;m surrounded all day by a half dozen blinking lights.  Thanks to email, office phone, personal email, iCal, and my wonderful BlackBerry, rss readers, etc, my day consists of bouncing my attention from one blinking light to another.  To top it off I get all of my work (and personal) email forwarded to my phone, so I get hit twice when I&#8217;m at work, often separated by a minute or less.  Let&#8217;s have a brief example of what occurred daily when I was at my desk.</div><div><blockquote>Oh, my email icon (on a mac) has a red badge on it, I need to check my email.  My voicemail light is blinking, better drop what I&#8217;m doing and listen.  My cellphone is blinking (or vibrating), I must have a text message, personal email, or voicemail, or just another copy of that email I read less than five minutes ago.  Ohh, 10 new stories in my feed reader, I can at least skim them real quick.</blockquote></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="">The straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, was counting how many emails I got one day.  The day that I counted, I received over </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">30 emails</span>.  That day was not extraordinarily busy and I didn&#8217;t even include text messages, personal emails, phone calls, or rss triage sessions.  At this point I should also mention how compulsively I checked my email, if the little badge popped up, I HAD to check my email, that second, and possibly respond, or else catch myself continually glancing at the little red icon. Combine that with the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/youve-got-interruptions/2008/09/08/1220857455459.html?page=fullpage">latest research showing it takes on average 64 seconds to regain your concentration after an email interruption</a> and you have a recipe for non-productivity. Some simple math shows that I was losing an average of 32 minutes of productivity just regaining my concentration, add in a minute or two actually dealing with whatever interrupted me and you&#8217;ve got a full hour of my day vanishing down the hole of non-productivity.  </div><div><br /></div><div>What&#8217;s worse, thanks to the little red badge, or a blinking phone, even if I managed to have the will power to ignore the new email or phone call that just came in, I&#8217;m anxious and distracted until I stop and look at the new message.  But thanks to my little experiment, in the last week I&#8217;ve learned how to regain those lost minutes and hours, without losing my connectivity to the rest of the office.  Now on to what I did that made such a big difference.</div><div><ol><li>I disabled any audible mail, or calendar sounds.  (I left pop-up alerts active on my calendar as it&#8217;s easy for me to get distracted and miss meetings!)</li><li>I found a wonderful (Mac only) application, that hides the unread mail indicator from Mail.app.  ( <a href="http://www.tonyallevato.com/node/1">Mail Badger )</a>  This allows me to only check my email when I am between tasks and not have a steadily increasing little red number staring at me all morning.</li><li>While I&#8217;m at my desk, I set my phone to a non-vibrate, non-blink, mode for all messages.  This dodges the &#8220;double email&#8221; problem mentioned earlier, as well as keeping me from dropping concentration to check a personal email.  To increase the effect (and due to an odd issue where the screen randomly brightens as it charges) I flip my cell phone screen side down on my desk.</li><li>I started screening my calls if I&#8217;m in the middle of a task.  Obviously some calls you answer right away, but some of them you let go to voicemail.  I&#8217;d done this for a while with my cell-phone, but doing it with my office phone as well has made a huge difference. While this doesn&#8217;t eliminate the distraction, it does make it as minimal as possible.</li><li>I taped over my voicemail light on my desk phone.  It doesn&#8217;t completely hide the bright red blinking light.  It still serves as a reminder to check (or act on) whatever call came in, but again it minimizes the distraction as best as possible.</li></ol></div><div>Obviously some of these steps won&#8217;t work, or don&#8217;t apply to everyone.  I&#8217;m still an addict, despite this little experiment.  But thanks to a few simple tricks, I have regained my productivity from the continual blinking lights.  Have other suggestions?  Put them in the comments!</div></div></div>
